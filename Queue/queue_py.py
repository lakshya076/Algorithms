A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

Putting items in the queue is called enqueue, and removing items from the queue is called dequeue.

A queue is an object (an abstract data structure - ADT) that allows the following operations:

    Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
    Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue
    IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
    IsFull: Check if the queue is full
    Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it

The complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue using an array is O(1).
